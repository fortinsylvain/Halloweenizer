RaspberryPi Pico MIDI and DMX512 Controller

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to control both MIDI and DMX512, creating a synchronized audiovisual experience for Halloween.

MIDI Integration

The Pico sends MIDI output to a Roland S-330 digital sampler, which plays eerie sounds, special effects, and haunting organ chords. These sounds, amplified through speakers, set the perfect spooky atmosphere.

DMX512 Lighting Control
The DMX512 output drives two RGB projectors, programmed to create dramatic lighting effects, including simulated thunderstorms and eerie color shifts to enhance the ambiance.

A permanent build is not planned at the moment, but the setup works well for its purpose.

Spooky Fun
This project was a blast to build, generating both frighteningly fun effects for kids and a satisfying challenge for the programmer!
