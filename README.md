RaspberryPi Pico Midi and DMX512 controller

This Raspberry Pi Pico is used to control a MIDI plus a DMX512 interface.
The MIDI output is send to a Roland S-330 digital sampler amplified with speakers.
The DMX512 output is connected to two RGB projectors.
Generated spooky sounds and light effects are intended to amuze the children 
and also the programmer :-)
